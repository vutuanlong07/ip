Deadline tasks are tagged with the tag `D`. The ending time of a `Deadline` task is called the deadline for convenience.

Without a starting time, this task type cannot be found with the `find` command if flag `/from` is set.

### 8. `event` command

Creates a task with both a starting and ending time, called an event task.

  - `/tags <tag>...`: a list of the names of the tags to search for.
  - `/from <start>`: the earliest time to find task.
  - `/to <end>`: the latest time to find task.
  - `/completed`: set this flag to search for completed tasks only. Takes priority over `/incomplete`.
  - `/incomplete`: set this flag to search for incomplete tasks only. Is set by default.
  - `/chain`: set this flag to search only from the last command's result

If no argument is given, the command returns nothing.

The result of this command can be operated on by other tasks by setting flag `/chain`.

  - `/to <end>`: the new ending time of the task
  - `/completed`: mark the tasks as completed. Takes priority over `/incomplete`
  - `/incomplete`: mark the tasks as incomplete
  - `/chain`: set this flag to edit tasks from the last command's result

Even if there is no actual change in value, the command still treats the task as modified.

### 11. `edit-all` command

Changes the properties of all tasks.

- Syntax: `edit-all [/description <description>] [/from <start>] [/to <end>] [/completed] [/incomplete] [/chain]`
